If a bean has one constructor, you can omit the @Autowired, as shown in the following example:
@Service public class DatabaseAccountService implements AccountService {
    private final RiskAssessor riskAssessor;
    public DatabaseAccountService(RiskAssessor riskAssessor) {         this.riskAssessor = riskAssessor;     }
    // ...
}
Notice how using constructor injection lets the riskAssessor field be marked as final, indicating that it cannot be subsequently changed.
