SpringApplication allows an application to be initialized lazily. When lazy initialization is enabled, 
beans are created as they are needed rather than during application startup. As a result, enabling 
lazy initialization can reduce the time that it takes your application to start. In a web application, 
enabling lazy initialization will result in many web-related beans not being initialized until an HTTP 
request is received.

A downside of lazy initialization is that it can delay the discovery of a problem with the application. If a misconfigured bean is initialized lazily, 
a failure will no longer occur during startup and the problem will only become apparent when the bean is initialized. 
Care must also be taken to ensure that the JVM has sufficient memory to accommodate all of the application’s beans and not just 
those that are initialized during startup. For these reasons, lazy initialization is not enabled by default and it is recommended 
that fine-tuning of the JVM’s heap size is done before enabling lazy initialization.

Lazy initialization can be enabled programatically using the lazyInitialization method on SpringApplicationBuilder or the 
setLazyInitialization method on SpringApplication. Alternatively, it can be enabled using the spring.main.lazy-initialization property as shown in the following example:
spring.main.lazy-initialization=true

If you want to disable lazy initialization for certain beans while using lazy initialization for the rest of the application, 
you can explicitly set their lazy attribute to false using the @Lazy(false) annotation.
