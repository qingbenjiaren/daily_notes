# Spring Web MVC Framework

The Spring Web MVC framework (often referred to as simply “**Spring MVC**”) is a rich “model view controller” web framework. Spring MVC lets you create special **@Controller** or **@RestController** beans to handle incoming HTTP requests. Methods in your controller are mapped to HTTP by using **@RequestMapping** annotations.
