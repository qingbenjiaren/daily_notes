What’s in a name
All official starters follow a similar naming pattern; spring-boot-starter-*, where * is a particular type of application. 
This naming structure is intended to help when you need to find a starter. The Maven integration in many IDEs lets you search dependencies by name.
 For example, with the appropriate Eclipse or STS plugin installed, you can press ctrl-space in the POM editor and type “spring-boot-starter” for a complete list.
 
 As explained in the “Creating Your Own Starter” section, third party starters should not start with spring-boot, as it is reserved for official Spring Boot artifacts.
 Rather, a third-party starter typically starts with the name of the project. For example, a third-party starter project called thirdpartyproject would typically be
 named thirdpartyproject-spring-boot-starter.
 
 such as spring-boot-starter-web  VS  mybatis-spring-boot-starter
