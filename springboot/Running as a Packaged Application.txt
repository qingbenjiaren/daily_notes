If you use the Spring Boot Maven or Gradle plugins to create an executable jar, you can run your application using java -jar, as shown in the following example:
$ java -jar target/myapplication-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
It is also possible to run a packaged application with remote debugging support enabled. 
Doing so lets you attach a debugger to your packaged application, as shown in the following example:
$ java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:server=y,transport=dt_socket,address=8000,suspend=n \ Â       -jar target/myapplication-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
