NIO网络编程框架
	Netty入门
		官网简介
			Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework 
			for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients.
			Netty is a NIO client server framework which enables quick and easy development of network applications such as protocol servers and clients. It greatly simplifies and streamlines network programming such as TCP and UDP socket server.
			Netty has been designed carefully with the experiences earned from the implementation of a lot of protocols such as FTP, SMTP, HTTP, and various binary and text-based legacy protocols. As a result, Netty has succeeded to find a way to achieve ease of development, performance, stability, and flexibility without a compromise.
		
		谁在使用Netty
